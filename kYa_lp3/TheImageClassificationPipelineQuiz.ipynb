The validation data is used to tune the model's hyperparameters, while the testing data is used to evaluate the final performance of the model.\n",

    "_Note_:  The testing data is a separate set of labeled data that is not used during the training or validation process. It is used to evaluate the final performance of the classifier and to estimate how well it will generalize to new, unseen data. It is important to use testing data that is representative of the real-world data that the classifier will encounter."
