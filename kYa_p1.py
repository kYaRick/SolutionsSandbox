# - What does the cv2.imread function do? 
#   -- Loads an image from disk.
# - What does the cv2.imshow function do? 
#   -- Displays the image to our screen.
# - Why is the cv2.waitKey function important? 
#   -- Without it, our image would be displayed to screen, but would close automatically.
# - Why do we use command line arguments?
#   -- To ensure variables can be supplied at script runtime.
# - Suppose we wanted to add a command line argument that requires a user to supply an 
# output image filename. What would that line of code look like?
#   -- So, my answer based on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50756306/syntax-for-ap-add-argument:
#   -- ap.add_argument("-o", "--output", required=True)

# - Suppose we have an image with 383 rows and 972 columns...
#   -- 372,276
# - Pixels in the RGB and grayscale color space are (normally) represented in the range:
#   -- 0 .. 255
# - OpenCV represents RGB images in which order?
#   -- BGR
# - Images are most commonly represented in which color space?
#   -- RGB
# - Suppose we wanted to construct the color blue using OpenCV. Of the options below, which is the correct representation of the color blue in OpenCV?
#   -- (255, 0, 0)
# - This time, letâ€™s construct the color red using OpenCV. How would we define this triplet?
#   -- (0, 0, 255)
# - The point (0, 0) corresponds to which corner of the image?
#   -- Top-left
# - Both Python and NumPy are zero-indexed?
#   -- Yes, both Python and NumPy are zero-indexed, meaning that the first element of an array or list is at index 0.
# - Download the code associated with this lesson. What is the (approximate) value of the pixel located at point x=111 and y=225?
#   -- I didn't search for the tutorial files so I just did it with the giraffe image and got this:
#   -- Blue: 154 Green: 192 Red: 238
