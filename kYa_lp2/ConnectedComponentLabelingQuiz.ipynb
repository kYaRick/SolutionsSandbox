    "1. **Connected-component labeling and contour extraction are the same thing.**\n",
    "- *Answer:  False*  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: Connected-component labeling and contour extraction are not the same thing, although they are related to each other. Connected-component labeling is a process in which different regions of an image are labeled with unique identifiers, where each region corresponds to a set of connected pixels with the same color or intensity. On the other hand, contour extraction is a process of extracting the boundaries of objects or regions in an image, which can be achieved using various techniques such as edge detection, thresholding, or gradient-based methods. Contours can be used for various purposes such as object recognition, shape analysis, and feature extraction.\n",

    "2. **The following are all types of connectivity except.**\n",
    "- *Answer:  9-connectivity*  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: Well... There is also the concept of \"m-connectivity\" which refers to a diagonal connection between pixels in a grid. However, 9-connectivity and 8-connectivity both refer to the concept of connecting pixels in a grid along horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions, while 4-connectivity only connects pixels along horizontal and vertical directions.  \n",
    "The incorrect statement is \"9-connectivity\". In image processing, the most commonly used types of connectivity are 4-connectivity and 8-connectivity, where pixels are considered connected if they share an edge or a corner, respectively. The concept of 9-connectivity does not exist in image processing, as it is not necessary to define an additional type of connectivity beyond 4- and 8-connectivity.\n",

    "3. **The goal of the first pass of the connected-component labeling algorithm is to:**\n",
    "- *Answer: Perform an initial labeling of all pixels in the image by examining neighboring pixels and their associated labels.*  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: The goal of the first pass of the connected-component labeling algorithm is to perform an initial labeling of all pixels in the image by examining neighboring pixels and their associated labels. This is done to establish a preliminary set of labels for each pixel based on the labels of its neighbors. The subsequent passes then refine and consolidate these labels to identify the actual connected components in the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **The goal of the second pass of the connected-component labeling algorithm is to:**\n",
    "- *Answer: Take the set of labels associated with each pixel and determine the actual connected components*  \n",
    "\n",
    "_Note_: The second pass of the connected-component labeling algorithm involves post-processing the labeled image from the first pass to group together pixels with the same label into connected components. This is done by iterating through the labeled image and replacing each label with the smallest label in its connected component. At the end of this process, all pixels in the same connected component will have the same label.  \n",
    "Option 1 is the goal of the first pass of the algorithm, not the second pass. Option 2 describes the overall goal of the algorithm but not specifically the second pass. Option 3 describes a post-processing step that may be performed after the connected components have been identified, but it is not the main goal of the second pass."
